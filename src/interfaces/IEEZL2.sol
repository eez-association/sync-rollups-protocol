//  IEEZL2 — L2 (EEZL2) execution structs.
//
//  L2 uses SELF-RELATIVE directional names, mirroring L1's directional style
//  (L1: `l2ToL1Calls` / `expectedL1ToL2Calls`). An L2's cross-chain counterparty
//  can be ANY rollup — L1 (mainnet) OR another L2 — so absolute names like
//  `l1ToL2Calls` would bake in a direction that is frequently wrong. Naming the
//  direction relative to THIS chain stays correct for every counterparty:
//    - an `incomingCalls[]` entry is a cross-chain call executed ON this L2 on
//      behalf of a remote caller (delivered through the caller's proxy). The
//      flat array is walked by the `_currentIncomingCall` cursor.
//    - an `expectedOutgoingCalls[]` entry is the pre-computed result of a
//      reentrant cross-chain call fired FROM this L2 toward a remote rollup
//      during execution (counted by the `_lastOutgoingCallConsumed` cursor).
//
//  Deliberately LEANER than L1's structs: L2 has a single rollup, no state deltas,
//  and no per-rollup queue interleaving, so the L1-only fields are dropped entirely
//  (no `StateDelta`, `destinationRollupId`, or `ExpectedQueueIndexPerRollup`). L2
//  never hashes a whole entry/lookup, so its layout is free to diverge from L1's.
//
//  Casing: types/events/errors are PascalCase (`CrossChainCall`, `OutgoingCallConsumed`,
//  `UnconsumedOutgoingCalls`); variables / struct fields / params are mixedCase
//  (`incomingCalls`, `expectedOutgoingCalls`, `_currentIncomingCall`).

///      are expressed via `LookupCall { failed: true }` consumed through `staticCallLookup`
///      (static-context entry point) or the failed-reentry fallback in `_consumeNestedAction`.
///      Naturally-reverting INNER calls inside an entry are still expressible: the proxy
///      `.call` returns `(false, retData)` and the rolling hash captures it via `CALL_END`;

/// @dev **`callCount` — flat-calls + reentrancy partition.**
///      `incomingCalls[]` is the FULL flat list of every call this entry will execute, in
///      execution order. It is partitioned between the entry's outermost frame and any
///      reentrant (outgoing) frames triggered during execution:
///        - `callCount`                          = iterations the entry's TOP-LEVEL `_processNCalls` runs.
///        - `expectedOutgoingCalls[i].callCount` = iterations the i-th reentrant frame's `_processNCalls` runs.
///      And the invariant after the entry finishes:
///        callCount + Σ expectedOutgoingCalls[i].callCount == incomingCalls.length
///      The on-chain `_currentIncomingCall` cursor advances monotonically over `incomingCalls[]` —
///      there's only one cursor across the whole tree. When a top-level call triggers a reentrant
///      cross-chain proxy invocation, control re-enters via `executeCrossChainCall`
///      → `_consumeNestedAction`, which calls `_processNCalls(expectedOutgoingCalls[i].callCount)`
///      on the SAME `incomingCalls[]` array, advancing the same cursor. Outer iteration resumes
///      where the cursor left off after the reentrant frame returns.
///
///      Worked example. `incomingCalls.length = 5`:
///        - call 0: top-level, no reentry.
///        - call 1: top-level, triggers a reentrant call → matched against `expectedOutgoingCalls[0]`,
///                  whose `callCount = 2` consumes calls 2 and 3 inside the reentrant frame.
///        - call 4: top-level, no reentry.
///      ⇒ `entry.callCount = 3` (calls 0, 1, 4 at the outer frame),
///        `expectedOutgoingCalls[0].callCount = 2` (calls 2, 3 inside the reentrant frame),
