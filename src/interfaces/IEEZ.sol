//  IEEZ — shared cross-chain interface + L1 (EEZ) execution structs.
//
//  This file holds:
//    - `ProxyInfo` and the `IEEZ` interface: direction-neutral, shared by the L1
//      (`EEZ`) and L2 (`EEZL2`) managers and by `CrossChainProxy` / `Bridge`.
//    - The L1-canonical, directionally-named execution structs consumed by `EEZ.sol`:
//        * an `L2ToL1Call` is a cross-chain call executed/replayed on L1 (flat
//          `l2ToL1Calls[]` array, walked by the `_currentL2ToL1Call` cursor),
//        * an `ExpectedL1ToL2Call` is a reentrant L1→L2 call fired during execution
//          (the `expectedL1ToL2Calls[]` table, counted by `_lastL1ToL2CallConsumed`).
//
//  The mirror-image L2 structs land in `IEEZL2.sol` (next iteration) with the
//  directions flipped. The two will be layout-identical (same field order + types);
//  only the names differ, so `abi.encode(entry)` — the preimage of L1's per-entry
//  proof hash — is unaffected by the split.
//
//  Casing: types/events/errors are PascalCase (`L2ToL1Call`, `L1ToL2CallConsumed`,
//  `UnconsumedL2ToL1Calls`); variables / struct fields / params are mixedCase with
//  the connector capitalized (`l2ToL1Calls`, `_currentL2ToL1Call`).

/// @dev **`callCount` — flat-calls + reentrancy partition.**
///      `l2ToL1Calls[]` is the FULL flat list of every call this entry will execute, in

///      reentrant (L1→L2) frames triggered during execution:
///        - `callCount`                       = iterations the entry's TOP-LEVEL `_processNCalls` runs.
///        - `expectedL1ToL2Calls[i].callCount` = iterations the i-th reentrant frame's `_processNCalls` runs.
///      And the invariant after the entry finishes:
///        callCount + Σ expectedL1ToL2Calls[i].callCount == l2ToL1Calls.length
///      The on-chain `_currentL2ToL1Call` cursor advances monotonically over `l2ToL1Calls[]` —
///      there's only one cursor across the whole tree. When a top-level call triggers a
///      reentrant cross-chain proxy invocation, control re-enters via `executeCrossChainCall`
///      → `_consumeNestedAction`, which calls `_processNCalls(expectedL1ToL2Calls[i].callCount)`
///      on the SAME `l2ToL1Calls[]` array, advancing the same cursor. Outer iteration resumes
///      where the cursor left off after the reentrant frame returns.
///
///      Worked example. `l2ToL1Calls.length = 5`:
///        - call 0: top-level, no reentry.
///        - call 1: top-level, triggers a reentrant call → matched against `expectedL1ToL2Calls[0]`,
///                  whose `callCount = 2` consumes calls 2 and 3 inside the reentrant frame.
///        - call 4: top-level, no reentry.
///      ⇒ `entry.callCount = 3` (calls 0, 1, 4 at the outer frame),
///        `expectedL1ToL2Calls[0].callCount = 2` (calls 2, 3 inside the reentrant frame),
///        and `_currentL2ToL1Call == 5` at the end (the `UnconsumedL2ToL1Calls` guard checks this).
