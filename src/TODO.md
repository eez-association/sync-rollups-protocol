# Smart Contract TODOs

## 1a. Failed entry (`entry.failed == true`) blocks the execution table

### Problem

When `_consumeAndExecute` processes an entry with `failed == true`, it executes all calls (to verify the rolling hash), then reverts with `entry.returnData` via assembly. But the `executionIndex++` that happened at the start of `_consumeAndExecute` is **rolled back** by the revert — because the revert propagates through `executeCrossChainCall`, which was called via `.call` from the proxy. The entire call context is undone.

Result: the failed entry is never consumed, `executionIndex` stays the same, and **every subsequent call hits the same failed entry forever**. The execution table is stuck.

### Scenario

```
User calls proxy → proxy calls executeCrossChainCall via .call
  → _consumeAndExecute:
    → executionIndex++ (0 → 1)
    → processes calls, verifies rolling hash — all good
    → entry.failed == true
    → assembly { revert(returnData) }
  → revert propagates: executionIndex rolled back to 0
proxy catches revert, returns failure to user

Next call: executionIndex is still 0, same failed entry, same revert → stuck forever
```

### Possible solutions

See `src/DISCUSS.md` for 3 approaches.

## 1b. Failed nested action (reentrant call reverts) blocks entry verification

### Problem

If a reentrant call (one that triggers `_consumeNestedAction`) reverts, the EVM rolls back all state changes in that sub-context — including the `_lastNestedActionConsumed++` increment (transient storage follows revert rules). The nested action is never consumed, so the entry-level verification `_lastNestedActionConsumed == entry.nestedActions.length` fails with `UnconsumedNestedActions`.

The current workaround is documented: "All nested actions must succeed. Failed calls should use StaticCall instead." But this pushes complexity to the off-chain precomputation, which must predict failures and route them through the static call path.

### Possible solutions

**A. Wrap failing calls in revertSpan (current design, off-chain)**

The off-chain precomputation wraps calls that trigger failed reentrant calls in a `revertSpan`. The `ContextResult` carries `_lastNestedActionConsumed` out of the revert context.

**B. Pre-consume nested actions before the proxy call**

Move consumption into the outer `_processNCalls` loop via a new field on `CrossChainCall` (e.g., `uint256 nestedActionCount`). Consumption happens in outer context, immune to inner reverts.

**C. Accept current design — document the constraint**

"All nested actions must succeed. Failed calls should use StaticCall instead."

## 3. `staticCalls` lookup is O(n) linear scan

`staticCallLookup` iterates over the entire `staticCalls[]` array to find a match. For entries with many static calls this could be gas-expensive. Consider:
- A mapping from `keccak256(actionHash, callNumber, lastNestedActionConsumed)` to index
- Keeping the array sorted and using binary search
- Requiring static calls to be ordered so sequential lookup works

---

## 5. No mechanism to clear a stuck execution table

If entries are posted via `postBatch` but cannot be consumed in the same block (e.g., a bug in off-chain construction), the execution table is stuck until the next `postBatch` overwrites it. Non-issue in practice: tables are one-block-lived and `postBatch` deletes previous data on each call.
