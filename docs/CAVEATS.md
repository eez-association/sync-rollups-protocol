# Caveats

## Edge Cases

- **Indistinguishable revert reasons when calling a proxy**: A caller (contract or EOA) cannot differentiate between a proxy call reverting because the execution table did not contain a matching entry vs. the underlying destination call actually reverting. Both cases bubble up as a revert from the proxy.

- **Opcodes that differ on cross-chain proxies**:
  - These opcodes return information about the proxy itself, not the proxied contract: `delegatecall`, `balance`, `extcodesize`, `extcodecopy`.
  - Block-state opcodes (`blocknumber`, `blockhash`, `blockgaslimit`, `chainid`, `coinbase`, …) reflect the chain the call is executing on, not the source chain — values will differ when the same logical action is observed on L1 vs L2.
